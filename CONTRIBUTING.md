# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to **AtroCore Docker**. Contributions of all sizes are welcome — documentation, bug fixes, refactors, tests, and new features.

Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.

---

## 1. Branch workflow

This repository follows a **main / develop** model:

- `main` — stable and production-ready.
- `develop` — active integration branch. **All merge requests target `develop`** unless maintainers specify otherwise.
- `feature/*` — new features, for example `feature/add-logging-module`.
- `fix/*` — bug fixes, for example `fix/ui-freeze`.
- `hotfix/*` — urgent fixes to `main`, for example `hotfix/crash-fix`.

### Example workflow

```bash
# 1. Start from develop and pull the latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull

# 2. Create a branch from develop
git checkout -b feature/awesome-improvement

# 3. Commit with Conventional Commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add awesome improvement"

# 4. Push the branch
git push origin feature/awesome-improvement
```

Then open a merge request targeting `develop`.

> Never commit directly to `develop` or `main`.

---

## 2. Commit convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for every commit message.

| Type | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | A new feature | `feat: add awesome improvement` |
| `fix:` | A bug fix | `fix: correct null handling` |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, tooling, or dependency updates | `chore: update dependencies` |
| `docs:` | Documentation-only changes | `docs: clarify setup instructions` |
| `test:` | Tests added or updated | `test: add unit test for new behavior` |
| `refactor:` | Internal change with no behavior change | `refactor: simplify initialization` |

Write meaningful messages:

- Good: `fix: correct null handling in diagnostics route`
- Poor: `update stuff`

---

## 3. Code style and tooling

These principles apply to every repository in this platform:

- Follow the conventions of the files you touch; keep diffs focused and readable.
- Avoid unrelated reformatting or refactoring in the same merge request.
- Update documentation when behavior, contracts, or configuration change.
- Add or update tests when changing logic.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, credentials, or private keys.
- Do not commit generated artifacts or local environment directories (`node_modules/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, database dumps, editor backups).

### Repository-specific tooling

- Configuration lives in `docker-compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `metadata/`, `sql/`, and `scripts/`.
- `metadata/` is the version-controlled source of truth for AtroCore entity metadata. Install it with `scripts/install-metadata.sh` (`make metadata-install`); do not leave entity changes only in the admin UI.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and supply local values. Never commit `.env`, `db-data/`, `web-data/`, or `db-dumps/`.
- Prefer the `Makefile` targets (`make up`, `make down`, `make db-backup`, `make metadata-install`, `make db-seed-nomenclatura`) over ad-hoc commands where one exists.
- Model changes must ship as tracked `metadata/` and `sql/` changes; a database dump is not a substitute for a reviewed entity definition.

## 4. Testing

Run the relevant checks locally before opening a merge request, and include the exact commands and their outcomes in the merge request description.

### Repository-specific checks

```bash
# Validate the compose configuration
docker compose config

# Build and start the stack
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify database access and the backup path
./scripts/backup-db.sh
```

Optional, in a disposable environment only (destructive to the target database):

```bash
./scripts/seed-demo-db.sh --yes
```

If your change affects scripts, infrastructure, or CI behavior, include the exact commands you ran in the merge request description.

## 5. Merge request checklist

Include the following in your merge request description:

- **Summary** — what changed and why.
- **Type** — `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`.
- **Testing** — exact commands run and their outcomes.
- **Scope** — affected modules, APIs, contracts, and documentation.

Checklist:

- [ ] My change follows this repository's style and tooling rules.
- [ ] I performed a self-review before requesting review.
- [ ] I updated or added documentation where needed.
- [ ] Relevant tests and checks pass locally.
- [ ] My commit messages follow Conventional Commits.
- [ ] I did not commit secrets, credentials, or generated artifacts.

---

## 6. Documentation and compatibility

- Update the README, `docs/`, and `example/` payloads whenever a contract changes — API routes, payload fields, schemas, document ID formats, or Alfresco folder paths.
- Keep identifiers and payload aliases backward compatible where practical, and call out breaking changes explicitly in the merge request.
- When a change spans more than one repository in this platform, open one merge request per repository and link them to each other.

---

## 7. Security and secrets

- Never commit secrets, tokens, credentials, or private keys.
- Configure sensitive values through environment variables or the repository's documented secret mechanism.
- Call out security impact explicitly in the merge request when a change touches authentication, authorization, or data access.

## 8. Licensing and notices

This repository is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

- Do not add third-party code or assets without preserving the required license notices.
- Keep existing third-party and upstream copyright headers intact.

## 9. Reporting issues and proposing changes

For large or cross-cutting changes, open an issue first to align on scope and approach before implementing.

When reporting a bug, include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, runtime and tool versions)
